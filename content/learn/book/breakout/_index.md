This tutorial will walk through writing an entire Breakout clone from start to finish, incrementally building upon previous functionality and refactoring similar to a full application.

This walk-through was based on the original [breakout example from the bevy repository](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples/game), with numerous additions.

This tutorial does assume you have already followed the [getting started](/learn/book/getting-started), and are familiar witht he basic concepts of Bevy. It is highly recommended that you review the getting started section prior to continuing with this tutorial.

The current version of Bevy as of this writing is bevy `0.2.1`
